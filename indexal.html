                    <p><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> (15
                    October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace
                    scientist, who served as the 11th President of India from
                    2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil
                    Nadu (India) and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
                    <br><br>He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
                    science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
                    Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
                    civilian space programme and military missile development
                    efforts. He thus came to be known as the <strong>Missile Man of
                    India</strong> for his work on the development of ballistic missile
                    and launch vehicle technology. <br><br>Widely
                    referred to as the <strong>People's President</strong>, he returned to his
                    civilian life of education, writing and public service after
                    a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious
                    awards, including the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of India.
